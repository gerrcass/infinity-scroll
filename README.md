# Infinity Scroll
Infinite scrolling allows you to keep loading more content when the scroll bar reaches the bottom of the page. In this codebase the Unsplash API is being used to keep loading photos; a AWS Lambda function is being used to avoid committing the Unsplash secret key and push this repo to Github Pages.
